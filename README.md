# blockerDNS Ad & Tracker Blocking Google Chrome Extension
blockerDNS blocks ads and trackers at the DNS level, which means you don't need to install any apps or extensions. But for cases where you may not want to, or be allowed to, change your DNS settings, this Chrome extension offers the same level of blocking, with the same lack of logging and data collection.

# Demo
