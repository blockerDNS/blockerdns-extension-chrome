# Overview
![blockerDNS](https://blockerdns.com/logo_github_repo.png "blockerDNS")

[blockerDNS](https://blockerdns.com/) blocks ads and trackers at the DNS level, the benefit being that you don't need to install any apps or extensions. But for cases where you may not want to, or be allowed to, change your DNS settings, the Chrome extension offers the same level of blocking along with the same _lack_ of logging or data collection.

## Demo
You can install the latest published version from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blockerdns-ad-tracker-blo/hnbnabjejnidmgpndhgcgmbhadhnicha).

## Install from Source
If you want to modify the code or play around with it, you can sideload it into Chrome. First download and extract the [ZIP file](https://github.com/blockerDNS/blockerdns-extension-chrome/archive/master.zip) or clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/blockerDNS/blockerdns-extension-chrome.git
```
Then go to Chrome's extension settings by typing __chrome://extensions__ in the address bar, enable __Developer mode__, choose __Load unpacked__ and go to the extracted or cloned folder.
