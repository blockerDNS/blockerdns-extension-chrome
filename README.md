# blockerDNS Ad & Tracker Blocking Google Chrome Extension
[blockerDNS](https://blockerdns.com/) blocks ads and trackers at the DNS level, which means you don't need to install any apps or extensions. But for cases where you may not want to, or be allowed to, change your DNS settings, this Chrome extension offers the same level of blocking, with the same lack of logging and data collection.

## Demo
You can install the latest published version from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blockerdns-ad-tracker-blo/hnbnabjejnidmgpndhgcgmbhadhnicha).

## Install from Source
If you want to modify the code or play around with it, you can sideload it into Chrome. First download and extract the [ZIP file](https://github.com/tambeb/blockerdns-extension-chrome/archive/master.zip) or clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/tambeb/blockerdns-extension-chrome.git
```
Then go to Chrome's [extension settings](chrome://extensions/), enable __Developer mode__, choose __Load unpacked__ and go to the extracted or cloned folder.
